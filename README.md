My own edited version, based on the original code by Ivan Miranda at https://www.ivanmiranda.com/diy-big-digital-clock 
but edited to work on the clock from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2968056 / https://github.com/NimmLor/7-Segement-Clock

Basically Ivan used 3 LED's per segment, the other one used 2 LED's. I had issues getting the software designed for it to work so
edited the original code to work with 2 LED's plus added a few little features like LED brightness and LED colour. Uploaded incase anyone
needs it plus a backup for myself.
